The 6 months Spotify gift card voucher is only available to Student Beans members.
The offer cannot be combined with any other vouchers and on-site promotions.
We reserve the right to either send a single Spotify gift card covering the 6 (or 3) months, or else multiple vouchers of the equivalent total value over the course of the 6 (or 3) month period for which the customer is eligible.
Customers must remain active acasa customers and pay all bills in full every month for the duration of the 6 (or 3) months to remain eligible for the duration of the offer.

After allocation, your free gift will be sent only after your first month's acasa Energy and/or acasa Broadband bill has been paid in full.

The giveaway offer cannot be redeemed in conjunction with any other discounts or offers.

Only one free gift per household upon completing sign up for acasa Energy and/or acasa Broadband.
