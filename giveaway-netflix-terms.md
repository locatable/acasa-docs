NETFLIX TERMS

These terms cover the 6 months Netflix giveaway that we (Locatable Ltd, trading as acasa) have made available.

To redeem the 6 months of Netflix (Basic subscription) giveaway you will need to sign up to both acasa Energy and acasa Broadband. You will be entitled to 3 months if you sign up to one of acasa Energy or acasa Broadband.

The offer is available until 30th Oct 2019 and while stocks last.

To qualify for your Netflix gift card, you must complete the promotional email entry form before making your purchase or use your promotional gift code at checkout if you have one. We will then allocate the Netflix voucher to your account upon completion of your order.

If using the promotion email entry form, the email address used to complete the entry form will need to be the same as that used to set up your acasa account and to complete your order for acasa Energy and/or acasa Broadband.

After allocation, your free gift will be sent only after your first month's acasa Energy and/or acasa Broadband bill has been paid in full.

The giveaway offer cannot be redeemed in conjunction with any other discount or offer.

Only one free gift per household upon completing sign up for acasa Energy and/or acasa Broadband.

All gifts are subject to availability, non-transferable and no cash or gift alternatives will be provided unless at our discretion.

Entrants agree to be bound by these Rules.
