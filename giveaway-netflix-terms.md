NETFLIX TERMS - UNiDAYS

These terms cover the Netflix giveaway that we (Locatable Ltd, trading as acasa) have made available.

To redeem 6 months of Netflix (Basic subscription) you will need to sign up to both acasa Energy and acasa Broadband. You will be entitled to 3 months (Basic subscription) if you sign up to only one of acasa Energy or acasa Broadband.

The offer is available until 30th Oct 2019 but may be withdrawn at any time at our sole discretion.

The Netflix gift card voucher is only available to verified UNiDAYS members. The offer cannot be combined with any other vouchers and on-site promotions. We reserve the right to either send a single Netflix gift card covering the 6 (or 3) months, or else multiple vouchers of the equivalent total value over the course of the 6 (or 3) month period for which the customer is eligible. Customers must remain active acasa customers and pay all bills in full every month for the duration of the 6 (or 3) months to remain eligible for the duration of the offer.

After allocation, your free gift will be sent only after your first month's acasa Energy and/or acasa Broadband bill has been paid in full.

The giveaway offer cannot be redeemed in conjunction with any other discounts or offers.

Only one free gift per household upon completing sign up for acasa Energy and/or acasa Broadband.

All gifts are subject to availability, non-transferable and no cash or gift alternatives will be provided unless at our discretion.

Entrants agree to be bound by these Rules.
